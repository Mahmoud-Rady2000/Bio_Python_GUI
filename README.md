# Bio_Python_GUI
GUI using Python and tkinter for do some operations on a DNA seq "FASTA files" .
The repo contain the project and fasta file for testing and some pics for the GUI.
steps to use the GUI : first you should have your data into a  file.fasta then run the project and you will find a button for reading the file named "upload fasta file" then you should put a seq num into the input cell and then click on "read record" and you will find your result below which contanin many things like : name, seq, GC content, reverse complement, RNA.
Hint: dont forget setup necessary libraries (I recommend use Pycharm for run this project).
Thanks.
